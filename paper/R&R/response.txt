Reviewer 1 is skeptical of the results from Figure 6, noting that fragmentation increases over this time period. This is a miscommunication on our part, which we have clarified
in the revised manuscript. All of the analyses in Section 4.4 (Figures 5 and 6) are restricted to low-fragmentation elections, so the varying effect sizes based on 
ideological distance and time period are not due to a shifting composition of high or low fragmentation countries.

Added a note on the changing number of elections over the course of Figure 6. As Reviewer 1 suspects, there are few low-fragmentation elections in our data between 1945 and 
1975 (only 38 of the 179). Subdividing the data in this way further reduces statistical power, and so the results should be interpreted cautiously. We add a note to this effect
on page 15.
